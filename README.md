# What is it?
The [EspoTek Labrador](http://espotek.com/labrador) is an open-source board that turns your PC, Raspberry Pi or Android Smartphone and into a full-featured electronics lab bench, complete with oscilloscope, signal generator and more.

This repo hosts all of the software and hardware that makes Labrador possible.

# Tutorial
If you're new to Labrador or oscilloscopes in general, I strongly recommend checking out the fantastic tutorial series produced by Lief Koepsel:   
https://www.wellys.com/posts/courses_electronics/  
It features well-written, rich articles as well as video content that explains everything more clearly than I ever could!  

# Getting Started
To download binary (executable) versions of the software, go to:  
https://github.com/espotek-org/labrador/releases

For the documentation, please visit:  
https://github.com/espotek-org/labrador/wiki 

# Raspberry Pi Build
***Please note that the 32-bit version of Raspbian version 9 (Stretch) or later is required to install this software.***

To install Labrador on the Raspberry Pi, open a terminal and paste the following command:  
`wget -O /tmp/labrador_bootstrap_pi https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espotek-org/Labrador/master/labrador_bootstrap_pi && sudo chmod +x /tmp/labrador_bootstrap_pi && sudo /tmp/labrador_bootstrap_pi`

This will automatically download, compile and install the latest version of the Labrador software from source.  The whole process will take around 20-30 minutes, so don't forget to pack a snack!  
After running it, a desktop entry will appear for the Labrador software (under Education), and running the `labrador` command from the terminal will launch the software interface.

# Building from Source
If you're looking to build from source but don't know where to start, Qt Creator is the easiest way to get your toes wet!  
https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/  
When installing, make sure you tick the box to install Qt 5.15 or later.

Once it's installed, open Desktop_Interface/Labrador.pro, then Clean All -> Run qmake -> Build All.

If you're on Linux (including Raspberry Pi), then you can also build the software from source by cloning the repo, cd'ing to the Desktop_Interface directory then running:  
```
qmake
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
Then, to launch, just type `labrador` into the terminal.

On Macos, additional steps may be required.  See issue https://github.com/espotek-org/Labrador/issues/238

To build the AVR software, I use Atmel Studio 7.  Just load up the .atsln and push F7.  You can use `avr-gcc` if you don't want to install a full IDE.

The PCB files can be edited in KiCAD 5.0 or later.
